For my project, I will be creating an app that shows you fingerings on a guitar. It will include the 6 basic chord shapes. It will also include recordings that play the voicing of the chord shown each time a user clicks on the corresponding chord. 
The interface will look like a fretboard. It will have 6 buttons (the 6 chords) with the name of the chord in the button. Mousepressed will trigger the button, playing the chord and showing the fingering. When a button is pressed, I will use true/false to run two functions: draw fingering, and run mp3. The mp3s will be recorded by me.
